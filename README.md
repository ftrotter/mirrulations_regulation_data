## Data License

Regulations data is public domain under the [edicts of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_government) principle. 

With this in mind, we are formally labeling the data as Public Domain, by using the [Creative Commons Public Domain mark](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/):

We have also added a text version of this assertion in the data_LICENSE.txt file. 

At one time, regulations.gov requested that data downloaded from the service include the following warning: 

```
Regulations.gov and the Federal government cannot verify and are not responsible for the accuracy or authenticity of the data or analyses derived from the data after the data has been retrieved from Regulations.gov.

In other words, "once the data has been downloaded from Regulations.gov, the U.S. Government cannot verify and is not responsible for the quality, accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any analyses conducted using the downloaded data."
```
Indeed mirrulations uses the Regulations.gov Data API but is neither endorsed nor certified by Regulations.gov.


## Warnings

There are unique risks associated with this public dataset, please read these warnings carefully.
There is a reason that the warnings come before the instructions in this ReadMe.

### Data Reliability Warning
The public domain status of this information means that you are free to use this data in any way that you would like. 
However, please note that much of our data is the results of the use of the Mirrulations Software, which, amoung other 
things, converts PDF to Text in various ways. This process can have bugs and as a result, it is possible that the text
generated by these processes is incorrect, incomplete or otherwise broken. The MIT license of the Mirrulations makes it clear
that we are fully disclaiming the liability for the use of the program, which means using the data is at your own risk. 
There are no warranties from us that the data is correct. 

### Privacy Warning

Further, many people likely did not understand that by contribiting to the regulatory comment process, they contributed their 
data to the public sphere. Many commenters appear to be assuming that only government regulators would be able to see and a
access their data. This means that it is likely that there is a substantial amount of data inside these comments that
people consider private, despite the fact that they have actually made it public information. Please be considerate 
to this risk as much as possible and do not use this data in a manner which takes advantage of this misunderstanding.
In a similar fashion, it is possible that people contributed data without fully understanding how this data could be 
used against them. In the era of Facebook and other companies that monetize private information, this might seem like a quaint 
idea, but as much as possible, please do not use this data to harm people. 

We cannot make you follow these rules, and anyone can go directly to regulations.gov and download this data directly, 
but we emplor you to use your best judgement when using this data. 

### S3 download costs

The authors of Mirrulations cannot afford to subsidize the download of regulation data. Therefore, Mirrulations is published using 
the [Requestor Pays Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) feature of Amazon AWS S3 product. 

If you download the S3 bucket in its entiretly this will result in an Amazon AWS bill of several hundreds of dollars. Even downloading just the text portion can be expensive. To save costs, please download only the portions of the text corpus that you need. 


## Downloading the data

In order to download the data, you will need to get your own AWS keys, and then [follow the directions for downloading requestor pays S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html). 

Most Amazon S3 clients do not support the requestor pays feature. However, [rclone](https://rclone.org/) does [support this](https://rclone.org/s3/#s3-requester-pays). We intend to support rclone for downloading purposes. 

### Understanding the Mirrulations folder structure

The Mirrulations project [documents the directory structure used in the S3 bucket](https://github.com/MoravianUniversity/mirrulations/blob/main/docs/structure.md).

Generally, the structure looks like this: 

```
data
└── <agency> (like DEA, CMS, etc)
    └── <docket id> (like DEA-2016-0015) 
        ├── binary-<docket id> (like 'binary-DEA-2016-0015')
        └── text-<docket id> (like 'text-DEA-2016-0015')
```        

Generally, the "binary" folder contains a mirror of the pdfs and word documents that people submit for comments to Federal regulations.
More rarely, these directories can contain jpgs, png and other image files that are submitted as comments. 

You are free to download these binary files, but the whole point of the Mirrulations project is to make the text contained in these pdf's available
as raw text. So if you look under the 'text' directory, you will find the OCRed versions of these resources. 

Mirrulations, by default, uses the [pikepdf](https://pypi.org/project/pikepdf/) tool to conduct OCR on the various documents. 
In the future, for PDFs that pikepdf does not cleanly OCR, other OCR tools will be used. This is the reason that under the OCR directories
there is a "tool" subdirectory, so that you can know what tool did the conversion between the binary file and the text file. 

Under the text-<docket id> directory, the following directories exist: 

* comments - for JSON files for comments submitted as raw text through regulations.gov
* comments_extracted_text - for the text results of the OCR process for pdfs/word/other files submitted as comments
* docket - for JSON files regarding the docket itself
* documents - For JSON files representing the documents that the government published inside the docket. 
* documents_extracted_text - for the text files that are the results of the OCR on the documents. 

here is a thousand words on the topic:

### using rclone to download portions of the data
     
#### Downloading only the text corpus
     
[rclone has advanced filtering capacity](https://rclone.org/filtering/) to download only portions of the data. Using that, you can use the following command to mirror all of the text contained in mirrulations (NOTE: this can be expensive!!):
     
```
rclone --s3-requester-pays copy s3:mirrulations /path/to/your/local/mirrulations/directory/ --include "*.txt" --include "*.json" --include "*.htm"
```
 
#### Download any agency     
To download every DEA regulation: 
 
```
rclone --s3-requester-pays copy s3:mirrulations /path/to/your/local/mirrulations/directory/ --include "/DEA/**/*.txt" --include "/DEA/**/*.json" --include "/DEA/**/*.htm"
```
     
Replace 'DEA' with your agency of interest to get more information     
     
#### Download any year     
The docket number of a regulation generally contains the year that the regulation was published. Thus, to download every regulation from 2022 we write:  
```
rclone --s3-requester-pays copy s3:mirrulations /path/to/your/local/mirrulations/directory/ --include "/*/*2022*/**/*.txt" --include "/*/*2022*/**/*.json" --include "/*/*2022*/**/*.htm"
```
