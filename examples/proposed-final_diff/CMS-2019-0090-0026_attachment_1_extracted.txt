Re: Secure Electronic Prior Authorization for Medicare Part D proposed rule (CMS–4189–P) 

Dear Administrator Verma: 

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the Secure Electronic Prior Authorization for Medicare 
Part D proposed rule (CMS–4189–P). 

Epic is an electronic health records (EHR) developer based in Verona, Wisconsin.  Epic makes software 
for mid-size and large medical groups, hospitals and integrated healthcare organizations – working with 
customers that include community hospitals, academic facilities, children's organizations, safety net 
providers and multi-hospital systems. Epic participates in industry standards development including 
standards organizations that impact medication communication such as the National Council for 
Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP), Health Level 7 (HL7), and X12.  Our integrated software supports 
both inpatient and outpatient providers and pharmacists, giving us valuable experience with the 
prescribing process for both physicians and pharmacists.  Through the use of Epic software, over 130 
healthcare organizations submit electronic prior authorization requests within their EHR workflow for 
prescriptions today. 

Our e-prescribing experience, as well as our broad general experience developing a sophisticated EHR 
and supporting the healthcare organizations that use it, inform the suggestions we make attached to 
this letter.  

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 

Cameron Szychlinski

Avoid Implementation of Two Different Electronic Prior Authorization Standards for 
Medications 
The proposed rule states that CMS’s purview in this proposal is limited to electronic prior authorization 
for Part D medications.  The expectation is that prior authorization for Part D covered prescriptions are 
transmitted according to the NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 standard whereas other prescriptions are 
transmitted according to the standards incorporated by HIPAA (X12 278 messages).   

Expecting two different standards to be used for the same workflow depending on payer selection will 
cause unnecessary burden.  Each messaging standard has its own requirements and pieces of 
functionality that change the workflow for the medical staff processing prescription prior authorizations.  
For example, the NPRM specifically discusses some of the limitations that the X12 278 standard has for 
workflow compared to the benefits of NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071.  Users should not need to understand 
that their prior authorizations will be handled different depending on whether this prescription is being 
covered under Part D or not.  Needing to understand these differences would be necessary if 
prescription prior authorization is completed according to two different messaging standards. 

We suggest the adoption of NCPDP SCRIPT 20170171 for electronic prior authorization signal the 
expectation of the use of that standard for all electronic prescription prior authorization transactions, 
regardless of payer or inclusion in Part D. 

Considerations when Adopting NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for Electronic Prior 
Authorization 
We agree that NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 should be used for all electronic prescription prior authorizations.  
Real-time processing and approvals of prior authorizations speeds up the availability of a medication to 
the patient, which in turns increases the likelihood of a patient adhering to the prescription written by 
their physician.  Likewise, with the industry currently moving to NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for other e-
prescribing transactions on January 1, 2020, we agree that using NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for electronic 
prior authorization allows for consistency across participants. 

However, as we plan to move the industry to NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for electronic prior authorization, 
please consider the following recommendations to adopt efficiently:  

Incorrect Assumption Regarding Prescribing System Readiness for Electronic Prior Authorization via 
NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 
The proposed rule assumes that a provider’s electronic prescribing software already has support for all 
NCPDP SCRIPT transactions, which is incorrect.  While electronic prescribing software developers are 
updating their systems to support NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for electronic prescribing, this support is likely 
limited to the transactions that were required by the developer’s users or by regulation.   

Since the existing CMS regulation does not name NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 as a transaction, it is unlikely 
there is support from vendors for the electronic prior authorization messages according to NCPDP 
SCRIPT 2017071.  Finalizing this rule will require development by electronic prescribing software 
developers and rollout of these updates by health systems. Sufficient time for development and rollout 
of new transactions must be allowed.

Allow 24 Months for Adoption 
The proposed rule requires adoption of NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for electronic prior authorization on 
January 1, 2021. We suggest that an implementation timeline of 24 months and a deadline of January 1, 
2022 would place less burden on the industry.   

In addition to development by the Part D pharmacy benefit managers, development will be required of 
electronic prescribing system developers to support NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071.   

Even if an electronic prescription system already supports electronic prior authorization, adopting 
NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 will require significant additional development by vendors across multiple 
versions of their software.  This development competes for development resources with migration to 
NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for other e-prescribing transactions and development required by the ONC 21st 
Century Cures Act NPRM. 

As stated in this NPRM, when NCPDP recommended the adoption of NCPDP SCRIPT 2017071 for 
electronic prior authorization, it was recommended that the industry be given a 24 month 
implementation window “due to the extensive coding required by Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and 
Part D plans to implement the change”.  We agree and feel a 24 month window for this development 
and implementation is more appropriate than the currently proposed mandate of January 1, 2021, 
which would only allow approximately one year for development and implementation. 

Determining if Prior Authorization is Needed 
The background section of this proposal states incorrectly that “An ePA transaction standard would 
allow a prescriber using an electronic prescribing (eRx) system or an electronic health record (EHR) with 
eRx capability to determine whether the beneficiary's plan requires a PA for a given medication”.  The 
electronic prior authorization standard produced by NCPDP is not designed to determine whether prior 
authorization is required for a particular medication.  Determination of whether a prior authorization 
should be accomplished through review of a patient’s formulary (such as through NCPDP Formulary & 
Benefit files) or through the use of Real-Time Prescription Benefit tools. 

Clarification of Usage 
In the proposed regulatory language, the wording references “between prescribers and dispensers”.  
The electronic prior authorization messages are not between prescribers and dispensers; they are 
between prescribers and pharmacy benefit managers.  We recommend updating the language as 
follows: 

 (7) Electronic prior authorization. Beginning January 1, 2021, Part D sponsors and prescribers must comply with the 
National Council for Prescription Drug Programs SCRIPT standard, Implementation Guide Version 2017071 
approved July 28, 2017 (incorporated by reference in paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section), to provide for the 
communication of a prescription or related prescription-related information between prescribers and dispensers 
Part D sponsors for the following transactions: 
(i) PAInitiationRequest and PAInitiationResponse 
(ii) PARequest and PAResponse 
(iii) PAAppealRequest and PAAppealResponse 
(iv) PACancelRequest and PACancelResponse
