Attention: Public Comment Medicare Program: Secure Electronic Prior Authorization for Medicare Part 
D Proposed Rule 

Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: 

Thank you for the opportunity to provide input on Medicare Program: Secure Electronic Prior 
Authorization for Medicare Part D Proposed Rule. The Minnesota e-Health Initiative (Initiative) is 
pleased to submit comments as a public-private collaborative focused on advancing the adoption and 
use of electronic health records and other health information technology, including health information 
exchange. A legislatively authorized 25-member Advisory Committee guides the Initiative (see Appendix 
A). The Minnesota Department of Health, Office of Health Information Technology, coordinates 
activities of the Initiative. 

The Advisory Committee recognizes the need to implement electronic prior authorization to support 
clinical best practices and improved patient experiences. We support requiring use of a single standard, 
the NCPDP SCRIPT Standard Version 2017071 electronic prior authorization (ePA) transactions, for Part 
D-covered products prescribed to Part-D eligible individuals. This proposed rule is consistent with 
Minnesota’s statutory requirements, and with our 2017 recommendations to the Governor of 
Minnesota to support full-implementation of all e-prescribing related transactions in the nationally 
recognized National Council for Prescription Drug Programs Standards (NCPDP), including electronic 
prior authorization and Formulary and Benefits (see Appendix B).

However, we even more strongly support adopting the standard for patients of all types of insurance 
coverage and for all products covered under the pharmacy benefit. The use of two different standards 
would be overly burdensome for the prescribers, creating dual workflows and new inefficiencies. 

We are concerned about the negative impact on Minnesota’s small and/or specialty organizations that 
use an array of EHR systems and have fewer resources to manage technical upgrades. Minnesota’s 
health care and technology landscape has a wide variety EHR and other systems in use, including:  

•
•
•

129 non-federal acute care hospitals using 8 different EHR systems.
1,500 primary and specialty care clinics using more than 40 different EHR systems.
7 local commercial health plans, multiple national commercial health plans, 3 county-based
purchasing organizations, and 1 state-based purchaser.

• Up to 18 different pharmacy benefit managers serving the Minnesota market.

We are also concerned that the use of two different standards will have a negative impact on patients. 
Prescribers would need to follow a different, less efficient, prior authorization workflow for patients 
who are not Part D beneficiaries. Further, patients who utilize multiple sources of payment may 
experience delays in authorization for their non-Part D medications. 

Finally, we recommend extending the implementation timeframe to at least 24 months from the date of 
the final rule to allow for technical and workflow implementation. We believe this to be consistent with 
industry recommended best practices.

Appendix B: Opioid and e-Heath Report: Summary of the 2017 
Minnesota e-Health Advisory Committee’s Opioids and e-Health 
Recommendations 

Introduction 
In response to the opioid epidemic, Governor Dayton requested the Minnesota e-Health Advisory 
Committee provide a set of recommendations for using e-health to prevent and respond to opioid 
misuse and overdose. The advisory committee, with input from the Opioids and e-Health Steering Team 
and Minnesota Department of Health, Office of Health Information Technology (OHIT), developed seven 
recommendations. The advisory committee believes implementation of the recommendations can have 
a significant impact on mitigating the opioid epidemic. OHIT developed this report to summarize the 
approach, recommendations and next steps of the advisory committee’s work on opioids and e-health.  

Approach 
The approach initially focused on the collection, use, and sharing of information necessary for the 
electronic prescribing of controlled substances (Figure 1) as requested by the advisory committee. With 
the request from Governor Dayton and input from the community, the scope was broadened to include 
additional uses of e-health to prevent and respond to opioid misuse and overdose. The following 
activities were critical to the development of the recommendations and building greater understanding 
of using e-health to prevent and respond to the opioid epidemic.   

Minnesota Environmental Scan 

Prescribers, payers, pharmacies and state agencies provided information and perspectives regarding the 
electronic health care information needed to address the opioid epidemic. The interviews focused on 
two areas including: 

1.  Whether and how such information is or could be exchanged via the types of data exchange subject 

to MN 62J.536 and 62J.495-4982; and 

2.  Any possible issues or constraints associated with the standard, electronic exchange or use of 

information needed to address the epidemic and how they might be addressed. 

Engaging Partners and Collecting Input during the Minnesota e-Health Summit 

During the 2017 Minnesota e-Health Summit’s, ‘Leveraging e-Health to Prevent and Respond to Opioid 
Misuse and Overdose’ session approximately 30 participants from across the care continuum shared 
feedback on:  

Preferred/recommended data sources; 
How information can best be provided/communicated via standard, electronic health business 
transactions and electronic health records; 
How electronic health data can be leveraged to help address the opioid epidemic; 
Key obstacles/challenges to providing/communicating the needed information; and 
Changes/solutions needed to address the challenges/obstacles.

Nationwide Scan of Strategies Implemented by States to Address Opioid 
Epidemic 

The scan obtained information about other states’ legislative and policy strategies for addressing the 
epidemic. Key words used in the review included: “opioids,” “EPCS” (electronic prescribing of controlled 
substances), “prescription monitoring program/prescription drug monitoring program,” (PMP/PDMP) 
“medical cannabis,” and “individual/patient education.”  

Opioids and e-Health Steering Team 

The Opioids and e-Health Steering Team provided input to the Advisory Committee on 
recommendations and strategies for using e-health to prevent and respond to opioid misuse and 
overdose. The participants of the Steering Team included experts in prescribing and dispensing 
controlled substances, e-prescribing controlled substances, and the Minnesota Prescription Monitoring 
Program. The Steering Team met twice and shared their perspectives and experiences during numerous 
advisory committee and public meetings.  

Recommendations  
The advisory committee believes implementation of the following recommendations can have a 
significant impact on mitigating the opioid epidemic. 

The advisory committee recommends that:  

1.  By July 2018, the Minnesota Legislature should provide resources to fully implement and ensure 
compliance with Minnesota Statutes Section 62J.497 including a focus on increasing the rate of 
e-prescribing of controlled substances from approximately 20 percent (Surescripts 2016 
National Progress Report) to over 80 percent by 2020. Implementation of this recommendation 
should occur with input from the Minnesota e-Health Advisory Committee to: 

a.  Provide or ensure statewide education and technical assistance on electronic 

prescribing (e-prescribing) of controlled substances. 

b.  Support full-implementation of all e-prescribing related transactions in the nationally 
recognized National Council for Prescription Drug Programs Standards (NCPDP), 
including electronic prior authorization and Formulary and Benefits.  

c.  Provide grants to increase the rate of e-prescribing of controlled substances. Grantees 
include, but are not limited to, prescribers that serve rural or underserved populations; 
prescribers that have small, independent practices; and other providers needing support 
such as dentists. 

d.  Support the use of evidence-based clinical guidelines and clinical decision support.  
e.  Monitor the status of e-prescribing, specifically for controlled substances, and assess the 

barriers to e-prescribing of controlled substances. 

f.  Develop and implement policy options including rulemaking and enforcement for non-

compliance of e-prescribing as needed, if goals are not met. 

2.  By January 2019, the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy, with input from the Minnesota e-Health 
Advisory Committee, health and health care provider associations, and other stakeholders, 
should develop requirements and an implementation plan to improve the Prescription

P R I O R   A U T H O R I Z A T I O N   P R O P O S E D   R U L E  

Monitoring Program (PMP). The requirements and implementation plan should include use 
cases and policies for the required use of the PMP. The implementation plan should:  
a.  Address affordable, effective and seamless use of the PMP by prescribers and 

b. 

dispensers through the EHR, other HIT, and integration into Minnesota’s HIE and include 
full implementation of clinical guidelines and clinical decision support and access to 
other states’ PMP information.  
Improve stakeholder input and oversight, representative governance, regulatory 
authority, and funding of the PMP to support alignment with state and federal 
requirements and standards, improve data quality and usability, support patient 
consent and privacy, and meet workforce-training needs. 

The Governor and Legislature should appropriate funds for the development and 
implementation of the requirements and implementation plan to improve the PMP.  

3.  By July 2018, the Minnesota Legislature should amend Minnesota Statutes, Section 152.126 to 
expand the permitted uses of Prescription Monitoring Program data. The updated language 
should ensure that state and federal agencies, tribal governments, academia, local public health, 
payers, and other partners are able to appropriately access and analyze information for 
improved prevention, response, and care while safeguarding patient privacy in accordance with 
state and federal law. Transparent processes and principles developed by the Board of 
Pharmacy with input from the Minnesota e-Health Advisory Committee and other stakeholders 
should guide access to the Prescription Monitoring Program data. Potential data uses should 
include, but are not limited to: 

a. 

Identify geographic areas and populations showing indicators of misuse and abuse to 
better target resources for prevention, response, and coordinated care, treatment, and 
services. 

b.  Ensure more timely and accurate responses to misuse and overdoses by leveraging 
other data sources such as overdose, toxicology, and drug seizure reports; medical 
examiner/coroner data; payer claims; poison control reports; and birth and death 
records. 

c.  Support the development and use of advanced clinical decision support and clinical 

guidelines to flag suspicious behavior and/or patterns and identify individuals at risk for 
opioid misuse at the point of care and beyond.  
Identify critical needs for training and best practices for prescribers, dispensers and 
other providers such as emergency medical services and local public health. 

d. 

The Governor and Legislature should appropriate funds to support the expanded uses of the 
Prescription Monitoring Programs data, and develop and implement the transparent processes 
and principles to guide access to data.  

4.  State agencies and associations should, by September 2018, review, update, and provide 

education on e-health and opioids policies and guidelines to ensure dispensers, prescribers, 
payers, and other providers, including the care team, have appropriate and timely access to 
health information, can subsequently share information, and understand their scope of action

related to the information. Use cases should include, but are not limited to, instances when 
prescribing and dispensing practices are outside nationally recognized clinical guidelines, such as 
those published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, and individuals are at-risk for misuse and abuse. 

5.  The Governor, by July 2018, should ensure access and coverage for all Minnesotans and 
providers, and provide resources for grants and technical assistance, to expand access to 
services and care enabled by telehealth, telemedicine and other forms of virtual technology to 
fill access gaps in opioid tapering and withdrawal, chemical dependency, mental health, and 
alternative pain treatment and services. 

6.  The Governor should support state agencies and stakeholders in participating in statewide 
coordinated HIE services. The support should be consistent with the findings of Minnesota 
Health Information Exchange Study, which will be submitted to the Legislature in February of 
2018, align with input from the Minnesota e-Health Advisory Committee, ensure providers and 
public health have access to information to support individual and community health services, 
and support: 

a.  Alerts for emergency services, urgent care, and other medical visits relating to 

substance misuse and overdose. 

b.  Referrals to substance abuse treatment and community services. 
c.  Access to patient health history including medication lists.  

7.  The Minnesota Department of Health, by December 2018, should submit to the Governor and 

the Legislature an update to their informatics profile that assesses the gaps in current 
information and information systems used to prevent and respond to substance misuse and 
overdose and identify resources needed to fill those gaps. The Governor and Legislature should 
appropriate funds to ensure those needs are met. 

The advisory committee also recognized that mitigating the opioid epidemic goes beyond e-health. 
There is a need for better access to and coverage for health services, specifically opioid tapering and 
withdrawal, chemical dependency, mental health and alternative pain treatment and services. 
Therefore, they also recommend the Governor work to ensure all Minnesotans have access to the 
treatment and services needed to achieve health and wellbeing.  

Next Steps 
The advisory committee and its stakeholders will continue to prioritize work to mitigate the opioid 
epidemic. In the coming months, it will move forward with the findings of the legislatively mandated 
study on HIE, which improves the seamless flow of information to prescribers and dispensers. It will 
continue to monitor and provide input into state and national activities regarding e-prescribing of 
controlled substances, Prescription Monitoring Program, and related issues.
