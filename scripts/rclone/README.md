This directory has a series of rclone commands that can be used to clone all or some of the mirrulations data to a local drive. 

In order to use it, you need to get the appropriate keys from Amazon, and then copy rclone.conf.example to rclone.conf, and put your keys inside!! 

Then run 

```
mirrulations_downloader.py
```
And it should guide you through your download options.
